# Encapsulation

The process of combining all of an object's attributes and methods into a single package.

**Information Hiding** or **Data Hiding**
- other classes should not alter an object's attribute

### Life Example:
Car does not need to tell driver/user how it burns fuel, how the transmission is working. It conceals those details. All user have to know is those exposed to them, e.g. how to accelerate, break and steer.
